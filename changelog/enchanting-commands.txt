Changelog:
Enchanting Commands
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchanting-commands

=========
v3.1: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v2.7: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.5: Improved compatibility with modded enchantments.
Improved code efficiency.
Updated mod description.

=========
v2.4: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.3: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.2: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.1: Improved compatibility with modded enchantments.

=========
v2.0: Added suggestions to the /ec command. You can now use Tab to autocomplete enchantment names.
The mod now gets available enchantments from the registry, instead of a list.
(1.19 only) Fixed the wrong enchantment being applied.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.8: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.7: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.6: Updated Enchanting Commands to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.5: The enchanting command is now compatible with command blocks.

=========
v1.4: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Updated modid. Updated usage text to work with any set command in the config.

=========
v1.3: [1.16.1 only] Updated mod to work with forge version 32.0.67 and above.

=========
v1.2: Added config option to change the default /ec command.
Fixed type in curse_of_binding enchantment string.

=========
v1.1: Updated modid.
Improved code efficiency.
