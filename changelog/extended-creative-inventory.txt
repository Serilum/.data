Changelog:
Extended Creative Inventory
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extended-creative-inventory

=========
v2.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v2.0: Released a Fabric version along side Forge in the same jar.
This includes a port to 1.19.2.

I think this mod will not be updated further than that, as 1.19.3 contained a big overhaul to the creative inventory, removing the need for it.

=========
v1.7: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.6: The mod now uses the correct SRG mapping name which fixes a crash on startup.

=========
v1.5: The mod now uses the ObfuscationReflectionHelper to find necessary fields. Which makes the mod more efficient and updating easier.

=========
v1.4: Fixed use of incorrect Mojang obfuscated mapping.

=========
v1.3: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code.

=========
v1.1: Updated Extended Creative Inventory to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
