Changelog: 
Villager Names
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/villager-names

=========
v7.1: Adds a new config option 'shouldCapitalizeNames'.
Fixes custom names not keeping their formatting.

=========
v7.0: Improved mod performance.
Changed the backend naming logic.
Fixed names not being applied correctly when spawning in a village.

=========
v6.4: The old default custom name list is now correctly ignored, and removed, when loading the mod.
This prevents villagers from accidentally receiving the previously used old custom config names.

=========
v6.3: (1.20.2) Added extra checks which mixins should be loaded, to prevent unwanted behaviour on NeoForge.

=========
v6.2: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v6.1: Fixed an incorrect mixin reference.

=========
v6.0: Villager professions will now be shown in the correct localized game language.
Added various config options to specify what and what shouldn't be shown on the villager trade screen.
When custom names are set, the default names will not be used by default. To prevent unintended villager naming. There is a config option to use both.
Updated mod to work with the JSON generation changes in Collective version 6.80.
Added extra support for various modded villagers.
And some other small backend bug fixes.

=========
v5.2: Changed how delays are done within the mod. It now uses a tick event, instead of Thread.sleep.
This improves compatibility with other mods.

=========
v5.1: Fixed the villager profession being shown twice on the trading screen.

=========
v5.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v4.4: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v4.3: Fixes the problems caused by Mojang's launcher update.

=========
v4.2: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v4.1: Fixed rare JsonSyntaxException due to mod incompatibility.

=========
v4.0: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v3.9: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v3.8: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.7: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v3.5: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.5: (Fabric only) Fixed incorrect mod URL.

=========
v3.4: Added support for all alphabets within the custom names file. E.g. cyrillic and georgian.

=========
v3.3: Improved compatibility for villagers with modded professions.

=========
v3.2: Villagers with a nametag with custom style will now keep that style when interacting with them.

=========
v3.1: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v3.0: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.9: Updated Villager Names to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.8: Added support for custom names with multiple names, every first letter is capitalized.
