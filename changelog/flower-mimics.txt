=========
v1.9: Fixed "Unable to find itemstack from NBT" being output incorrectly in the console logs.

Updated mod URLs to the new GitHub location.
(NeoForge) Updated to the new changes: Added 'type=' to mods.toml, and moved the modEventBus field.

=========
v1.5: Improved mod incompatibility in server environments.

=========
v1.4: (1.20.2) Added extra checks which mixins should be loaded, to prevent unwanted behaviour on NeoForge.

=========
v1.3: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

They can still be transformed, but would have to be added manually.
