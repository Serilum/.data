Changelog:
Village Spawn Point
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/village-spawn-point

=========
v4.1: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

=========
v3.1: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.0: Fixed Biome Spawn Point and Village Spawn Point compatibility.
The mod now works correctly server-side with the Collective 5.17+.
Now logs messages correctly when creating a new world.

=========
v2.8-2.9: Added support for Biome Spawn Point. With both installed and configured, you now spawn in a village near the chosen biome.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.

=========
v2.6: (Forge) Adds support for modded world types such as TerraForged.

=========
v2.5: Decreased world loading time by a lot. Fixing the issue of having to wait at 0% generation for a long time.
Added support for modded villages.
Added log messages for when the mod starts looking for and has found a village.

=========
v2.4: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.3: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v2.2: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.1: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.9: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.8: A bonus chest is now placed around the village spawn position if the generate bonus chest world generation option is enabled.

=========
v1.7: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.5: Updated Village Spawn Point to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.4: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.3: [1.16.2 only] Fixes ClassCastException when generating a world.

=========

Fixed worlds not generating when structure generation was disabled.

=========
v1.1: Released 1.15.2 version.
