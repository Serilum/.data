Changelog:
Automatic Doors
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/automatic-doors

=========
v4.5: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v4.4: Changed computeIfAbsent to use Collective's HashMapFunctions. This adds compatibility with threaded dimensions.

=========
v4.3: You can now (temporarily) disable the mod by setting doorOpenTime to 0.
Changed Thread.sleep to use a tick event instead.

=========
v4.2: Changed how values in HashMaps are put. Instead of using an event, it uses the computeIfAbsent Java function.
This fixes incompatibilities with other mods creating dimensions/levels without using the event.

=========
v4.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v3.0: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.9: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.8: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.6: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.3-2.4: Fixed doors not closing after last update.

=========
v2.2: Fixed doors closing incorrectly when multiple players were nearby.

=========
v2.1: Improved multi-dimension support.
Fixed the mod not working as intended in multiplayer.

=========
v2.0: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.9: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.8: Updated Automatic Doors to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.7: Fixed doors not automatically opening when on top of a path block.

=========
v1.6: Fixed doors opening automatically when in spectator mode.

=========
v1.5: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Improved code efficiency.

=========
v1.4: Updated modid.
Improved code efficiency.
Fixed issue of (double) doors sometimes staying open.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.3: Added a config option to not automatically open doors when sneaking.
Fixed an issue of doors spamming sounds when standing near.

=========
v1.2: The doors now make sound when opened and closed.

=========
v1.1: Made it so that the doors won't close when the player is still standing next to it.
Opening iron doors can be toggled off in the config.

=========
v1.0: initial release of mod.
