Changelog:
GUI Clock
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gui-clock

=========
v4.3: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v4.2: Added drawTextShadow config option, enabled by default. Makes the overlay text more readable.
The rendering is now stopped when the F3 screen is open.

=========
v4.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v3.9: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.8: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v3.7: The mod now correctly changes the height of the time in the GUI with lowerClockWhenPlayerHasEffects enabled. For positive and negative effects.

=========
v3.6: Fixed holding a clock in the offhand not counting towards having one in the inventory.
Updated backend code.

=========
v3.5: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v3.4: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.3: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.3: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v3.1: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.0: Added feature to lower the clock when a potion effect is active, to prevent overlap. Can be toggled with the 'lowerClockWhenPlayerHasEffects' config option, enabled by default.

=========
v2.6: Added clockWidthOffset config option to allow users to change the x coordinate of the clock. Fixed the clock icon not actually being centered with clockPositionIsCenter and showOnlyMinecraftClockIcon enabled.

=========
v2.5: Fixed showOnlyMinecraftClockIcon not working correctly in combination with mustHaveClockInInventoryForGameTime set to false.

=========
v2.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.3: Updated GUI Clock to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.2: Fixed clock being outside of the screen when changing certain config values.

=========
v2.1: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v2.0: Fixed potion effects overlapping the GUI clock.

=========
v1.9: Added config option 'showOnlyMinecraftClockIcon', disabled by default. Which when enabled makes only the Minecraft clock icon show on the screen instead of time in numbers.

=========
v1.8: Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.7: Added day counter. Enabled by default, can be turned off in the config.

=========
v1.6: The 12-hour clock format now actually works as intended.

=========
v1.5: Fixes the 12-hour clock not displaying correctly.

=========
v1.4: Backend code improvement.

=========
v1.3: Game time now correctly syncs with the server.

=========
v1.2: Added mustHaveClockInInventoryForGameTime and mustHaveClockInInventoryForRealTime config options.

=========
v1.1: You can now show both in-game time and real time simultaneously.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
