Changelog:
End Portal Recipe
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/end-portal-recipe

=========
v5.1: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v5.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v4.2: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v4.1: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v4.0: Removed the extra right-click event check. The portal can now be created by just placing the portal blocks in the correct direction.
Added a configurable option to send a message to the player where the extra dragon egg drops.
If the dragon was killed by anything other than a player, the mod now has an extra check for players around to give the dragon egg to.
Updated mod description.

=========
v3.0: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.9: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.8: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.6: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.5: Updated mod to work with the new Tool functions in Collective. Fixed issue of end portal block not being able to be picked up.

=========
v2.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.3: Updated End Portal Recipe to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Fixed recipe typo. Improved how the dragon egg drops from the Ender Dragon.

=========
v2.1: Fixed config file not generating correctly.

=========
v2.0: Updated modid.
Improved code efficiency.
Added two config options;
  Only allow portal frames to be picked up with Silk Touch
  Put broken portal frames directly into the inventory to lower the chance of losing them.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.1: Changed the way how the mod detects pickaxes. Paxels and other modded pickaxes are now also supported when breaking end portals.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
