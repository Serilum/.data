Changelog:
Better Spawner Control
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-spawner-control

=========
v4.3: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v4.2: (1.19.4 only) Fixed mob spawns not being canceled correctly.

=========
v4.1: (1.19.4 only) Updated mod to work with the changes to MobSpawnEvent in Forge version 45.0.23.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

=========
v3.2: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.1: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.

=========
v3.0: Improved performance by resetting the mob spawner delay after a spawn was denied by the mod, instead of having it keep checking for a possible spawn.
Fixed mob spawns sometimes not being blocked.
Updated mod description.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v1.9: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.8: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.2: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.6: (Fabric 1.18 only) Updated mod to work with 1.18.2 and future snapshots.

=========
v1.6: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.5: Updated backend code. Fixed mobs still spawning in 1.17.1. Synchronized versions.

=========
v1.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.3: Updated Better Spawner Control to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Updated modid.

=========
v1.1: Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
