=========
v3.5: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v3.4: Fixed helmets not being added to the armor stand correctly.
Improved mod performance.

=========
v3.3: Fixed the chest generating too low when players died on non-full blocks, for example paths.
(1.20 only) Fixed the player's name not being updated correctly on the death sign.

=========
v3.2: Fixed the armor stand being created in the wrong place.

=========
v3.1: Fixed the helmet slot not being put on the armor stand with addPlayerHeadToArmorStand disabled.

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v2.2: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.0: Fixed the totem of undying effect not being applied.
Fixed mustHaveItemsInInventoryForCreation set to false not working correctly.
Fixed a bug which duplicated the player's main hand when the armor stand creation was set to false.
Fixed a crash when another mod increases the player inventory size.
Removed a debug line.

=========
v1.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v1.5: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v1.4: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.3: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.2: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.1: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
