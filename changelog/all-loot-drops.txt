https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/all-loot-drops

=========
v3.2: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v3.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v3.0: Released a Fabric version of All Loot Drops, alongside the Forge version in the same jar file.

=========
v2.6: Added the 'keepOriginalLootQuantityIfHigher' config option to fix an unintended nerf when a mob drops more than the set lootQuantity.
(1.19) Fixed magma cubes not dropping a Froglight when consumed by a frog.

=========
v2.5: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.4: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.3: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.2: Updated All Loot Drops to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.1: Fixed old name format in mod reference. Fixed mobs not always dropping all their loot.

=========
v2.0: Updated mod name and modid.
Improved code efficiency.
The mod now works with any entity that has a loot table, modded included. It uses the Collective library to procedurally generate all possible drops on first load.
Added two config options, which allow the looting enchant to have an effect on loot quantity.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.3: Improved compatibility with other mods.

=========
v1.2: Fixed rare nullpointerexception.

=========
v1.1: Fixed a bug where the mod altered players' inventories.

=========
v1.0: initial release of mod.
