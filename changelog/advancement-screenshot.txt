Changelog:
Advancement Screenshot
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancement-screenshot

=========
v4.4: (1.20.2) Added extra checks which mixins should be loaded, to prevent unwanted behaviour on NeoForge.

=========
v4.3: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v4.2: Added the 'takeScreenshotTickDelay' config option, to improve compatibility with other mods.
(1.20 only) Fixed the mod not taking screenshots correctly.

=========
v4.1: Fixed mixins not being applied correctly for Forge.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v3.9: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.8: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v3.7: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v3.6: (Forge only) Changed the mixin file name to be unique, fixing overlap with other mods.
If the mod wasn't working before, this will most likely fix it.

=========
v3.5: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.4: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v3.2: Increased mod compatibility by disabling mixins when another mod changes the target method, which before this would cause a hard crash.

=========
v3.1: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.0: The mod now works separate from the in-game chat, adding support for other languages than English.

=========
v2.0: Fixed the mod not working correctly when installed on the client and playing in a multiplayer environment. It is now completely client based.

=========
v1.5: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.3: Updated Advancement Screenshot to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.1: Fixed the mod preventing a server from launching when included in the mods folder. This is a client-side only mod, but the server will ignore it when present.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
