Changelog:
Stack Refill
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stack-refill

=========
v4.1: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

=========
v3.3: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.2: Fixed a crash when a pair variable was null, due to an incompatibility with another mod.

=========
v3.1: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.

=========
v3.0: The big 3.0 rewrite!
Improved code performance.
Fixed visual desyncs in the inventory, the mod now works better with clients.
Fixed snowballs and firework rockets not refilling.
Fixed crash due to mod incompatibility.
FIxed the offhand slot not being refilled correctly.
Improved refill during item tossing.
Fixed items sometimes not returning their container after consumption.

=========
v2.7: Fixed incorrectly set mod version.
Updated mod description.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric) Updated Stack Refill to work with the latest changes in Collective version 4.63.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v2.4: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.3: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v3.3: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.1: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.0: Updated backend code. Fixed a bug where right-clicking a block with a shovel would put another shovel from the inventory in the offhand.

=========
v1.9: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.8: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.7: Updated Stack Refill to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.6: Increased compatibility with other mods.

=========
v1.5: Thrown eggs can now be replaced. Removed debug console logs accidentally left in.

=========
v1.4: Fixed water buckets being replaced when catching fish. Improved support for modded blocks, such as a sieve from Ex Nihilo.

=========
v1.3: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.2: Added compatibility for milk buckets and fishing rods.

=========
v1.1: The mod can now replace items being tossed on the ground.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
