=========
v3.4: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.
The dependent Areas version is now 5.2.

=========
v3.3: (1.20 only) Fixed area text not being updated correctly on signs.

=========
v3.2: Changed computeIfAbsent to use Collective's HashMapFunctions. This adds compatibility with threaded dimensions.

=========
v3.1: Changed how values in HashMaps are put. Instead of using an event, it uses the computeIfAbsent Java function.
This fixes incompatibilities with other mods creating dimensions/levels without using the event.

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

v2.0: The mod has completely been rewritten. This fixes various issues.

You can now remove a sign created by the mod and place your own if you want. Make sure it's within a 15 block radius of the old sign.
The mod is, combined with the latest Collective update, now compatible with modded villages.
