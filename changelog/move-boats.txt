Changelog:
Move Boats
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/move-boats

=========
v3.1: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Released a Fabric (and Quilt) version alongside the Forge version. They're both in the same jar file.

=========
v2.0: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.9: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.8: The fall distance of the held boat is now set to 0 while moving to prevent the boat being broken in transport.

=========
v1.7: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.5: Updated Move Boats to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.4: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.3: Fixed being able to hold the boat while riding it, resulting in a magical journey through the sky.

=========
v1.2: Changed default config value.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.1: Updated modid. Added a config option to only pick up the boat when the player is sneaking.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
