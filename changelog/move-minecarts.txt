Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========

=========
v3.1: Updated mod logo and summary.

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Released a Fabric (and Quilt) version alongside the Forge version. They're both in the same jar file.

=========
v2.0: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.9: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.8: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

v1.7: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.6: Updated Move Minecarts to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========

Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: The config file now actually generates.

=========

v1.0: Initial release of mod.
