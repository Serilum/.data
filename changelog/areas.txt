Changelog:
Areas
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/areas

=========
v5.2: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v5.1: Added support for the JSON file generation changes in Collective version 6.80.

=========
v5.0: The big 5.0 update!
Lots of code has been rewritten.
Improved performance.
The displaying of areas now works client-side only!
For randomly generated area names, the mod still has to be installed on the server.
Fixed the /areas command not always working correctly.
Added new config options for better control over what the GUI shows.
Added shadow to the area text.
Fixed the game crashing when setting the area range too high.
Fixed the area name sometimes not going away correctly.
Fixed a crash with an empty range input.
Added compatibility with unicode characters.
Added compatibility with modded signs.

=========
v4.4: (1.20 only) Fixed sign text not being updated correctly when area name is left empty.

=========
v4.3: Changed computeIfAbsent to use Collective's HashMapFunctions. This adds compatibility with threaded dimensions.

=========
v4.2: Changed how values in HashMaps are put. Instead of using an event, it uses the computeIfAbsent Java function.
This fixes incompatibilities with other mods creating dimensions/levels without using the event.

=========
v4.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v3.3: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.2: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v3.2-3.1: Cleaned up code in preparation for Fabric port.

=========
v3.1: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.0: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.9: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.8: Improved backend code to make the server environment work more reliable.

=========
v2.7: Fixed area signs not being registered correctly when first placed in a multiplayer environment. Updated backend code.

=========
v2.6: The mod now uses the correct SRG mapping name which fixes a crash on startup.

=========
v2.5: The mod now uses the ObfuscationReflectionHelper to find necessary fields. Which makes the mod more efficient and updating easier.

=========
v2.4: Fixed incorrect obfuscated mojang field, fixes issues of areas not being rendered correctly.

=========
v2.3: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.2: Updated backend code.

=========
v2.1: Added /areas command which displays all area signs nearby, so you won't lose them.

=========
v2.0: Extended sign caching to improve code efficiency.
Overlapping areas with the same name will now work correctly, and not display the entering/leaving message.
Added config option 'HUD_FontSizeScaleModifier' to add the ability to increase font size.
Signs now change their content to a default state when entering only the zone prefix and nothing else.

=========
v1.4: Added config option 'giveUnnamedAreasRandomName', enabled by default, which generates a random name for an area if there is no name input. See the description for an example.

=========
v1.3: Updated Areas to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Improved mod compatibility, in this case specifically Minecolonies. Fixed IllegalArgumentException when using custom RGB values.

=========
v1.1: Fixed the mod crashing when using a custom RGB values with extra spaces. Any amount of spaces is now parsed into the correct numbers.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod. Based on Named Areas, but completely rewritten from scratch, with multiplayer in mind.
