Changelog:
Giant Spawn
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/giant-spawn

=========
v4.8: (1.20.2) Added extra checks which mixins should be loaded, to prevent unwanted behaviour on NeoForge.

=========
v4.7: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v4.6: Giants with helmets on no longer burn in the daylight.

=========
v4.5: Changed computeIfAbsent to use Collective's HashMapFunctions. This adds compatibility with threaded dimensions.

=========
v4.4: Changed how values in HashMaps are put. Instead of using an event, it uses the computeIfAbsent Java function.
This fixes incompatibilities with other mods creating dimensions/levels without using the event.

=========
v4.3: Fixed mixins not being applied correctly in Forge.

=========
v4.2: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v4.1: Updated mod to support the Collective version 6.4 release.

=========
v4.0: Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v3.4: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.3: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v3.2: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v3.1: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.0: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.8: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.7: Updated how to mod handles setting giants on fire in daylight, improved multi-dimension support.

=========
v2.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.4: Updated Giant Spawn to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.3: Improved code efficiency. Backend code tweaks.

=========
v2.2: Improved mod efficiency, improved backend code.

=========
v2.1: Fixed giants burning in daylight even when there was a solid block above.

=========
v2.0: Improved code efficiency.
Added custom AI to giants, based on the zombie AI. They now move!
Added config options to change Giant movement speed and attack damage.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.0.2: Fixed exception unique to the 1.14.4 version.

=========
v1.0.1: Updated issue unique to the 1.14.4 version.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
