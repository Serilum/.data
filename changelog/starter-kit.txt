=========
v6.1: Adds backwards compatibility when updating from Starter Kit version 5.5 to 6.0+.

=========
v6.0: The big 6.0 update!
Without extra configuration, the mod remains the same. '/starterkit set' still exists.
Old starterkit files are automatically converted to the new format.
See the description for examples!

There are (a few) extra features:
Improved tracking to see if a kit should be given. Inside the world folder.
Added support for potion effects to give alongside the starterkit gear.
You can add multiple kits, with an option to let players choose or give one randomly.
Players can choose kits, when enabled, via a custom GUI inventory screen.
If the mod is not installed on the client, players can still choose a kit via commands.
Kit descriptions! Give your instance more of an RPG-vibe with kit backstories.

There are 3 new (inactive) default starterkits, as an example of how the configuration works.
These kits are the inactive folder by default: Archer, Lumberjack and Witch.

Added an alias for /starterkit, /sk.

As an admin you can use the following new commands:
  /sk add (kit_name)
    Adds your current inventory to the active kits.
  /sk set (kit_name)
    Sets your current inventory as the only active kit.

  /sk give <player> (kit_name)
    Give a player a random (or specific) starter kit.

  /sk activate <kit_name>/_all
    Moves kit_name or all kits from inactive to active.
  /sk deactivate <kit_name>/_all
    Moves kit_name or all kits from active to inactive.

  /sk list (inactive)
    Lists all active (or inactive) kits.
  /sk reset
    Resets all tracking. Players receive another kit on join.
  /sk reload
    Reloads starter kit changes from the config folder.

...and probably some more I forgot. Hope you like the new changes!

=========
v5.5: Added enablePlayerMustBeNearSpawnForKitCheck config option.
Increased the delay before giving a kit from 5 to 10 ticks.

=========
v5.4: Improved mod icon compression, which lowers the jar file size.
Updated mod URLs to the new GitHub location.
(NeoForge) Updated to the new changes: Added 'type=' to mods.toml, and moved the modEventBus field.

=========
v5.3: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v5.2: Changed how delays are done within the mod. It now uses a tick event, instead of Thread.sleep.
This improves compatibility with other mods.

=========
v5.1: Fixed the addExistingItemsAfterKitSet config option not working correctly with some items.
Added support for § (section sign) in books to colour text.

=========
v5.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v4.2: (Fabric) Updated Starter Kit to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v4.1: Improved compatibility with other mods by running the starter kit giving logic on the next tick. This will make sure all items given by other mods are caught.
You can use the addExistingItemsAfterKitSet config option to determine what is done with those items.

=========
v4.0: Changed the default config file to use NBT data by default.
Improved handling of other mods adding items on startup such as books. They can either be removed completely or re-added after the kit has been set. Configurable via 'addExistingItemsAfterKitSet'.
Fixed some custom books not being saved correctly.
Cleaned up code.

=========
v3.9: Fixes the problems caused by Mojang's launcher update.

=========
v3.8: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v3.7: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v3.6: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v3.5: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.4: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.7: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v3.2: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.1: Fixed nullpointer when a command was run by a non-player.

=========
v3.0: Added support for FTB Team Islands, can be toggled in the config. The starter kit will also be set after the '/ftbteamislands create' command.
Of course a fully optional dependency.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric only) Improved how the mod loads items from the config in a server environment.

=========
v2.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v2.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.4: Improved a lot of the backend code, the mod now runs more efficiently.

=========
v2.4: Improved a lot of the backend code, the mod now runs a lot more efficient.

=========
v2.3: Updated Starter Kit to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Fixed non-critical error message in console.

=========
v2.1: Fixed starter kit config not being accepted with extra lines in the file.

=========
v2.0: Added '/starterkit set' command, which writes the entire inventory of the player using the command to the config file. This also means NBT Tags for things like enchantments and written books are now supported.

=========
v1.1: Fixes issue of itemstacks getting out of sync in multiplayer environments.

=========
v1.0: initial release of mod.
