Changelog:
Tree Harvester
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tree-harvester

=========
v8.3: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v8.2: Improved how the mod determines which leaves should be broken.
Fixed the harvest speed difference not being applied correctly in a server environment.

=========
v8.1: Improved mod performance.
Fixed trees incorrectly being harvested without crouching.
Fixed a crash during leaf decay due to a mod incompatibility.
Fixed stripped logs being seen as tree logs.

=========
v8.0: This update contains a very big overhaul of the backend mechanics which makes the mod work.
Cleaned up code, segmented core features.
Changed how the mod determines which leaves should be broken. No more leaves being left behind!
Fixed sound events not being handled on Fabric's side.
Fixed more than one mangrove swamp tree being broken simultaniously.
Improved compatibility with modded axes.
Removed the instantBreakLeavesAround config option. You can increase amountOfLeavesBrokenPerTick for the same functionality.

=========
v7.4: Changed computeIfAbsent to use Collective's HashMapFunctions. This adds compatibility with threaded dimensions.

=========
v7.3: Changed how values in HashMaps are put. Instead of using an event, it uses the computeIfAbsent Java function.
This fixes incompatibilities with other mods creating dimensions/levels without using the event.

=========
v7.2: Improved the check whether two logs are the same, increasing compatibility with other mods.
Added support for mangrove trees.
Improved check that determines which leaves should be broken.
Fixed normal and flowering azalea leaves not seen as the same leaf type.
Fixed the instant break leaves config option working differently than fast leaf decay.
The sound of instant breaking leaves is now as if breaking one block.
Fixed some modded sapling replacements causing a crash.
Changed the default value of increasedHarvestingTimePerLogModifier from 0.1 to 0.2.
Updated backend code.

=========
v7.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v7.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v6.0: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v5.9: Fixes the problems caused by Mojang's launcher update.

=========
v5.7-5.8: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v5.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v5.5: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v5.4: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v5.3: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v5.2: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v5.1: Fixed chopping down log blocks being slow without it being part of a tree.

=========
v5.0: The big 5.0 update!
Improved the algorithm behind which logs and leaves should be broken. This creates better remaining trees (next to the one harvested) and no more floating leaf blocks.
Huge mushrooms can now be harvested just like trees.
The amount of time it takes to harvest a tree is determined by the amount of logs.
Added config option to increase/slow down fast leaf decay.
Improved the search for a bottom block for 2x2 trees.
Added compatibility with Stack Refill.
The mod now fires the BlockBreak and BlockPlace event.
Added blacklist feature to disable certain axe types from being able to harvest trees.
Overall improved backend code.

=========
v4.2: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v4.1: Tree Harvester will now only work with logs of the same type, which is determined on the first log broken. This is to prevent unwanted behaviour with other trees or structures nearby.

=========
v4.0: Updated backend code.
Added better compatibility for smaller and modded trees.
Added config option 'automaticallyFindBottomBlock' which allows chopping down an entire tree via a middle block, enabled by default.
Added the config options 'loseDurabilityModifier' and 'increaseExhaustionModifier' to change the amount of durability and exhaustion on chopping down a tree.
(Forge only) Fixed the 1.12.2 version replacing an incorrect sapling type.

=========
v3.2: Fixed the config value enableNetherTrees not being parsed correctly.

=========
v3.1: Saplings placed on custom dirt (e.g. modded, podzol, coarse) are now placed correctly after tree harvest. The mod now relies on Collective's Block Compare functions.

=========
v3.0: Added support for the warped trees in the nether. This can be disabled in the config. Improved support for modded saplings.

=========
v2.9: Fixed the 1.12.2 version not working on servers. Extended compatibility for modded trees by using BlockTags.

=========
v2.8: Fixed the mod thinking flowers and grass around the tree were leaves. Now only actual leaves are broken (fast leaf decay) when chopping down a tree.

=========
v2.7: Updated mod to work with the new Tool functions in Collective. Updated 1.17.1 version for changes in 37.0.24.

=========
v2.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v2.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.4: Updated Tree Harvester to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.3: Improved a lot of backend code. The mod is now correctly runs events to make it compatible with other statistic mods. Improved fast leaf decay for bigger trees. Fixed modded tool durability behaving incorrectly.

=========
v2.2: Fixed issue of saplings not being replaced. Fixed issues of axes not breaking correctly. Improved code efficiency. Improved the way the mod chooses the correct sapling from drops.

=========
v2.1: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v2.0: Added fast leaf decay function. The sapling can get replaced after the last leaf block has been broken.

=========
v1.7: The mod is now compatible with other mods that add a broken-tool variant instead of removing the axe on reaching the maximum durability damage.

=========
v1.6: Changed the default config value of 'instantBreakLeavesAround' from true to false.

=========
v1.5: Added config option 'instantBreakLeavesAround' which can be set to false to prevent leaf brocks from being broken when chopping down a tree.

=========
v1.4: [1.16.2 only] Fixes ClassCastException when chopping down a tree.

=========
v1.3: Improved mod efficiency.
Improved function to find and break all leaves around trees using the amount of logs found.
Added config option (enabled by default) to increase exhaustion per log harvested. Same behaviour as vanilla when breaking a block.

=========
v1.2: Separated sound code to client-only. The mod now works in multiplayer environments again.

=========
v1.1: The mod now works with all modded trees.
Fixed sound spam when using the mod to chop down a tree.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
