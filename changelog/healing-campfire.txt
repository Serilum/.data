Changelog:
Healing Campfire
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/healing-campfire

=========
v5.2: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v5.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v5.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v4.1: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v4.0: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v3.9: Added support for modded campfires.
Updated mod description.

=========
v3.8: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v3.7: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.6: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v3.4: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.3: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v3.2: Updated Healing Campfire to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v3.1: Changed the default config value of 'hideEffectParticles' from false to true.

=========
v3.0: The mod is now more efficient.
Added the config options 'checkForCampfireDelayInTicks', 'campfireMustBeSignalling', 'enableEffectForNormalCampfires'(1.16+) and 'enableEffectForSoulCampfires'(1.16+).
Fixed issue of players having the regeneration effect but not getting healed.
The regeneration effect will now refresh when players have half the configured duration left and are near the campfire.

=========
v2.3: Improved code efficiency.
Fixed the regeneration effect not applying correctly.
Added configurable option for the level of regeneration.
Switched dependency from FAB Library to the Collective library mod.

=========
v2.2: The effect by default now only works when a campfire is lit. This can be toggled in the config.

=========
v2.1: Added 0.75 seconds to the duration in seconds to prevent the timer from jumping back and forth when close to a campfire.
The mod now immediately detects a campfire placed and gives the healing effect.

=========
v2.0: Lots of code rewritten, bugs fixed.
The mod is now dependent on FAB (Find A Block) Library, which efficiently keeps track of blockstates in the world. In this case we want to of course check for a campfire block nearby.

=========
v1.7: The mod now uses the WorldTickEvent instead of the PlayerTickEvent, which should make it a lot more efficient on servers.

=========
v1.6: The mod can now heal modded passive entities as well.

=========
v1.5: Fixed some issues.

=========
v1.4: The mod now requires less computation.
Improved multi-world support.

=========
v1.3: Added a config option to hide the particle effects from the campfire regeneration.

=========
v1.2: Updated modid. Code improvement, less computation.

=========
v1.1: Campfires can now heal passive mobs as well as the player when they're within the radius around the campfire. This can be toggled off in the config file.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
