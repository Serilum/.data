Changelog:
Omega Mute
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/omega-mute

=========
v3.2: (1.20.2) Fixed incorrect class reference on NeoForge.

=========
v3.1: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

=========
v2.9: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.8: Fixes the problems caused by Mojang's launcher update.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v2.4: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.3: (Forge 1.19 only) Fixed mod not loading correctly.

=========
v2.2: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.0: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.9: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.8: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.7: Updated Omega Mute to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.6: Fixed the mod preventing a server from launching when included in the mods folder. This is a client-side only mod, but the server will ignore it when present.

=========
v1.5: Fixed hotkey firing when typing in an open chat.

=========
v1.4: You can now use the omega mute commands without cheats-access. Added configurable hotkey to reload the omega mute sound file. By default it's a dot .

=========
v1.3: [1.16.1 only] Updated mod to work with forge version 32.0.67 and above.

=========
v1.2: Fixed the mod causing issues when being loaded in a server environment. It just does nothing now.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.1: Added culling feature, see the description for more details. For example, you can now play a sound every 10 seconds. Immersive yet not distracting.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
