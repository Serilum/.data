Changelog:
Silence Mobs
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/silence-mobs

=========
v3.1: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v2.8: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v2.4: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.3: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.1: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.0: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.9: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.8: Updated Silence Mobs to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.7: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Fixed config descriptions.

=========
v1.6: [1.16.1 only] Updated mod to work with forge version 32.0.67 and above.

=========
v1.5: If an unnamed entity is unsilenced, it now removes the custom nametag completely.

=========
v1.4: Added support for entities with a custom name. Toggling the silence of them will result in "Silenced Name" and "Name" back.

=========
v1.3: Fixed incompatibility issues with modded entities.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: Fixed the name colour functionality after jar export.

=========
v1.1: Tweaked usage documentation within the mod.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
