=========
v7.4: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v7.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v7.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.

=========
v5.8: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v5.7: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v5.6: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v5.5: Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.
Added 1.19 heads: allay, cold frog, temperate frog, warm frog, tadpole, warden.

Updated backend code.

=========
v5.2: Fixed reference to incorrect method in 1.16. Updated backend code.

=========
v5.1: Fixed non-jmh default heads (creeper/zombie/skeleton) not dropping when harvested.

=========
v5.0: When breaking placed down mob heads, they now correctly keep their mob head name on pickup.
Fixed grammatical mistake in log.
Fixed a crash due to incompatibility with the More Axolotl Variants mod and improved future compatibility with others.

Added config option to restrict head drops to charged creepers only.
Updated backend code.
(Fabric only) fixed /jmh command not being registered correctly.

=========
v4.2: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v4.1: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v4.0: Updated Just Mob Heads to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v3.9: Fixed steve heads dropping for mobs without head texture data.

=========
v3.8: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Changed jeb_sheep droprate to 0.2.

=========

Hoglin, Piglin, Zombified Piglin, Strider and Zoglin.

=========
v3.4: The mod now checks existing config files for missing drop values, and appends any missing to the end of the file. This allows for keeping your custom drop values and still get the values for newly added mobs.

=========
v3.3: Fixed steve heads dropping when the mod couldn't find a head texture, with modded entities. Now drops nothing instead.

=========
v3.2: Updated sheep head textures.

The Looting enchant now has an effect on the head drop chance. This can be enabled/disabled within the config file. The chance is 3.5% at level I, 4.5% at level II, and 5.5% at level III and so forth. It also works on looting levels higher than 3.

There is a seperate drop chance for all three, which is active if the specific drop chances have been enabled.

=========
