Updated structure and content of mod info files.

If the bee hive cap config wasn't working before, this will most likely fix it.

=========
v2.6: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.5: Added the `beeHiveBeeSpace` config value which overwrites how many bees can go inside a hive.
Improved code efficiency.
Improved compatibility with other mods.
Fixed a server hang/crash on world generation.

=========

=========
v2.3: Updated backend code.
Fixed a crash due to a mod incompatibility causing a ServerHangWatchdog error.
Fixed multiple bees spawning during breeding.
Fixed baby bees suffocating. All suffocation damage has been disabled for bees, can be toggled in the config.

=========
v2.2: Extra bees are now spawned on the next world tick, instead of immediately when the first bee spawns. Using the new Collective code. This should fix some backend issues.

=========
v2.1: The bee's stinger is now removed when a player dies.

=========
v2.0: Bees are now tiny! By default 1/4th of the vanilla size. This can be changed in the config though, they can even be bigger! Fixed multiple bees spawning from breeding and other mods using bee bottles. Updated backend code, improved efficiency.

=========
v1.5: Fixed bees spawning during world gen causing a deadlock in combination with other mods.

=========
v1.4: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.3: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.2: Updated Realistic Bees to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.1: Improved compatibility with chunk pre-generation mods.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
