Changelog:
Easy Elytra Takeoff
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-elytra-takeoff

=========
v4.1: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

=========
v3.3: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.2: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.

=========
v3.1: (Fabric) Added support for modded elytra's such as wings and colytra.
 Added support for the mod Elytra Boosters.

=========
v3.0: Improved takeoff code! Easier taking off with less simulated rockets.
The mod now uses TickEvents instead of a delayed function.
Fixed being able to use a free rocket by taking the elytra off mid-air and re-equiping it.
Improved performance.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.4: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.2: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.2: (Fabric only) Fixed mod not working correctly due to an incorrect mapping.

=========
v2.1: The mod now uses the correct SRG mapping name which fixes a crash on startup.

=========
v2.0: The mod now uses the ObfuscationReflectionHelper to find necessary methods. Which makes the mod more efficient and updating easier.

=========
v1.9: Fixed incorrect obfuscated Mojang mapping usage.

=========
v1.8: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.7: Updated Easy Elytra Takeoff to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.6: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Updated modid.

=========
v1.5: Added support for the Curious Elytra mod.

=========
v1.4: [1.16.2 only] Improved backend code.
Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.16.2.

=========
v1.3: It's now possible to take off from the ground while holding a rocket in your offhand.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: Adds compatibility with Colytra

=========
v1.1: Code improvement.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
