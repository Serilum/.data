Changelog:
Cycle Paintings
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cycle-paintings

=========
v3.4: (1.20.2) Updated mod to work with the changes in NeoForge version 20.2.59-beta.

=========
v3.3: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v3.2: Fixed an IndexOutOfBoundsException with modded paintings.

=========
v3.1: Fixed paintings not saving their cycled variant correctly.
The mod now correctly checks for the PaintingVariantTags.PLACEABLE tag, so it doesn't cycle unplaceable paintings.

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v2.9: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.8: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.7: Cleaned up code.
(Fabric) Fixed painting cycle not working with modded paintings.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.4: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.3: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.2: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.1: Added two config options.
ignorePaintingsInCycleResourceLocation and showRegisteredPaintingsDebug.
The first allows you to exclude certain paintings from showing up in the cycle, the other to find paintings to exclude via the console and debug lines.
By default the paintings from 
Infernal Expansion are excluded because they should only show up with their separate painting item.

=========
v2.0: You can now cycle the painting in reverse by crouching while clicking a painting with another in hand.

=========
v1.8: (1.17.1 only) Updated mod to work with the changes made to entity removal in 37.0.24.

=========
v1.7: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.6: Improved compatibility with modded paintings. Improved code efficiency.

=========
v1.5: Updated Cycle Paintings to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.4: Fixed some modded paintings being lowered a block when cycling through them.

=========
v1.3: Improved compatibility with other mods which add paintings.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

Adds compatibility for modded paintings.
